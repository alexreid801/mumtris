# Mumtris

This is a tetris game in MUMPS, for GT.M, have fun.

Resize your terminal (e.g. maximize your PuTTY window), restart GT.M so that it can report true size of your terminal, and d ^mumtris.

*NOTICE: Mumtris uses "active waiting" for making delays lower that 1s. That means that one of your CPU will be used at 99%. It's not a bug, the Mumtris and GT.M will be fully responsive. Take care when running on production system ;-)*
